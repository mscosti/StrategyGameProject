StrategyGameProject
===================

All iterations of the 'Stratego' game that was developed in an Object Oriented Analysis and Design course, 
in order to learn about writing reusable and maintainable code through the use of design patterns.

This project was completed in different itteration (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon)
which called for making additions to the project and changing the rules as we went.  We had to make
our code flexible in order to make these changes simple and to avoid changing code we have already written.
